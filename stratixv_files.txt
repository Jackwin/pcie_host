The DriverWizard has created:
* A Kernel PlugIn driver project kp_stratixv.sys, which demonstrates how to communicate with your hardware directly from the kernel mode.
* A sample diagnostics application for testing the communication with
  your hardware from the user mode.
* Library files, which include API for controling your hardware and communicating between the user-mode application and Kernel PlugIn driver.
 The library is used by both the user-mode application and the Kernel PlugIn project

  E:/chunjie/fast-wps/pcie/pcie_statixV/stratixv_files.txt
         A detailed overview of all the generated files.

  E:/chunjie/fast-wps/pcie/pcie_statixV/stratixv_lib.h
         A library for controlling your hardware through WinDriver.

  E:/chunjie/fast-wps/pcie/pcie_statixV/stratixv_lib.c
         Contains the implementation of the functions used for
         accessing each of the resources defined in the Wizard.

  E:/chunjie/fast-wps/pcie/pcie_statixV/stratixv_diag.c
         The sample user-mode application which diagnoses your
         hardware using the stratixv_lib.h library.

  E:/chunjie/fast-wps/pcie/pcie_statixV/kermode/kp_stratixv.c
         The Kernel-Plugin source code.

  E:/chunjie/fast-wps/pcie/pcie_statixV/x86/msdev_2010/stratixv_diag.sln
         Microsoft Developer Studio Solution File
         for the X86 (Win32) Platform.

  E:/chunjie/fast-wps/pcie/pcie_statixV/x86/msdev_2010/stratixv_diag.vcxproj
         Microsoft Developer Studio 10.0 (.NET 2010) Project File
         for the X86 (Win32) Platform.

 E:/chunjie/fast-wps/pcie/pcie_statixV/kermode/x86/msdev_2010/kp_stratixv.vcxproj
         Microsoft Developer Studio 10.0 (.NET 2010) Project File
         for the Kernel PlugIn.

  E:/chunjie/fast-wps/pcie/pcie_statixV/stratixv.inf
         A formatted reference file for Windows that contains
         information about installation files and devices, such as
         filenames, version information and so on.

Compiling this project:
  For MSDEV.NET 2010, open Visual Studio 2010 .NET, load x86\msdev_2010\stratixv_diag.sln and compile

Converting to a GUI application:
  This sample was written as a console mode application (rather than
  a GUI application) that uses standard input and standard output.
  This was done in order to simplify the source code. You may change it
  into a GUI application by removing all calls to printf() and scanf()
  functions, and calling MessageBox() instead.
